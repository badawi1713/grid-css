#### Guide steps:
1. Create a layout for each sections; top navigation bar, carousel content, content title, book lists content, and aside navigation.
2. Then I decided to use Grid layout that consist of 1 column, by 1fr (fraction) that includes of all sections, but aside navigation.
3. After I finished to create the homepage layout, I need to make the homepage become responsive by using media queries in the CSS file.
4. And for the Carousel interaction, for carousel section I used the Flickity (javascript library) so user can interact with the content on the carousel section.

#### That's All, Thank you!
